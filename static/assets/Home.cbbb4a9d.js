With the rapid development of Chinese society and the acceleration of urbanization, the demand for in-depth analysis of China's population data is growing. However, although the seventh Chinese census provides rich demographic data, these data are often presented in lengthy reports that lack intuitive presentation methods, making it difficult for the general public to understand and utilize. Therefore, this study aims to use data visualization technology to present the seventh Chinese census data on a public-facing website in an interactive and intuitive manner to promote a deeper understanding of China's population situation.

Through this website, users can easily explore various aspects of China's population, including but not limited to age structure, gender ratio, urban and rural distribution, etc. In addition, the website will also provide functions such as historical data comparison to help users better understand the historical trajectory and future direction of China's population development.
